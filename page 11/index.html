             <h3>Meaning of Vaundy - 裸の勇者 (Hadaka no Yusha) (English
              Translation) by Genius English Translations</h3>
            </div> <br/>
            <div class="about-the-song">
              The song "Hadaka no Yusha" (Naked Hero) by Vaundy explores
              themes such as love, strength, and self-acceptance. The lyrics seem to
              describe a hero who is struggling with inner demons, represented by the
              "malice" that they need to shake off. The hero is trying to
              overcome their inner struggles while also dealing with external
                challenges, such as the "sorrow that flew from somewhere."
              Despite their difficulties, the hero remains determined to protect what
              they love, and find enough light to do so.

            <div class="about-second">
              The song also touches on the importance of love, which is described as
              both a source of strength and a force that can break things apart. The
              hero is bonded with someone through tears of sorrow and strength, but is
              also skeptical of the love they share. Throughout the song, the hero seems
              to be on a journey of self-discovery and self-acceptance, learning to let
              themselves be and overcome their doubts and fears.
            </div>
            <div class="the-lyrics">
              The lyrics also mention a rusty sword that nobody can use, perhaps
              symbolizing the hero's own sense of inadequacy or unworthiness.
              However, the hero is encouraged to tear apart the darkness and embrace
              their true power and potential. Overall, "Hadaka no Yusha" seems
              to be a song about overcoming one's inner demons and doubts, finding
              strength and light in love, and embracing one's true self to become a
              hero.
