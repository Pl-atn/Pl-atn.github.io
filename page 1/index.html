            Vaundy is a Japanese singer, songwriter, and producer. A
            “self-produced” artist, he handles every component of the music
            production process, including lyrics, composition, and arrangement—as
            well as artwork design, music video production, and more. The
            multi-talented artist is commonly attributed to the rise of the digital streaming era

            The name Vaundy originates from a nickname he was given after a funny
            incident in middle school. In a

          <span class="second-paragraph-span">
            , he shared that during his school’s routine health examination, he
            accidentally bumped into someone and rebounded off the wall like a
            ball. People started calling him “Bound Ball,” or a “bounce ball” in
            English. This was shortened to “Baundy” (Japanese version of
            “Bouncey”) 
            <br />
            Later, he changed it to “Vaundy” for his artist name, switching the
            ‘B’ to ‘V’ for a more impactful touch. Despite the alteration, the
            pronunciation of his name in Japanese remains the same.

            Vaundy’s music blends various genres, including pop, rock, R&amp;B,
            hip-hop, synth-pop, and city pop. Vaundy began making music in his
            third year of middle school, using the digital production software
            Cubase. During high school, he also became active in the Vocaloid
            community as an “utaite,” (歌い手), a Japanese term for people who
            cover existing Vocaloid and J-pop songs. These covers are shared
            online through the platform
