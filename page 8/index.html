                      "Tokyo Flash" (東京フラッシュ) became Vaundy's breakthrough
                      moment. Released in November 2019, the song surpassed 1 million
                      views within two months of its release. This put Vaundy's name
                      in the spotlight, helping him to get recognized in the music
                      industry.
                      <br />
                      In a 2020 interview, Vaundy shared that he frequently listened
                      to city pop while creating this song.

                  The music video for "Tokyo Flash," which was released on YouTube in
                  September 2019, was shot late at night in Shinjuku, Ueno, Shibuya,
                  Asakusa, and other places that evoke a sense of Tokyo. The director
                  is MIZUNO CABBAGE, who is an old friend of Vaundy and is also active
                  as a VFX artist.

                  His signature song, "Tokyo Flash," is a Vaundy-style city pop with
                  catchy guitar riffs and mellow sounds. The music video is a one-shot
                  video of Vaundy walking aimlessly through the streets of Tokyo late
                  at night.

                  "When I made 'Tokyo Flash,' I was listening to a lot of city pop,
                  and I listened to the songs that were selling right now and the ones
                  that were on a lot of playlists, and I was like, 'What do they have
                  in common?' I thought about it as I made it. Also, I think melody is
                  more important than anything else.

                  The distinctive guitar riff that sounds from the beginning of this
                  song is also a simple one that you can hum after one listen. In this
                  day and age, many people listen to music by streaming, so if you
                  think it's different, you'll be immediately skipped to another song.
                  That's why it's so important to have a grip that makes you want to
                  listen to it for more than five seconds.

                  "The producer of 'Tokyo Love Story' told me that he wanted to use
                  'Lamp' in a drama. This song is not a love song, but rather a song
                  sung for the same generation, but when I saw the drama, I was really
                  into it. It could be heard in the songs of each of the four main
                  characters. In order for many people to listen to it, it may have
                  been good to be aware that the songs can be perceived in a variety
                  of ways.
