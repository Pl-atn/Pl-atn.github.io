          , he shared that during his school’s routine health examination, he
          accidentally bumped into someone and rebounded off the wall like a ball.
          People started calling him “Bound Ball,” or a “bounce ball” in English.
          This was shortened to “Baundy” (Japanese version of “Bouncey”) 
          <br />
          Later, he changed it to “Vaundy” for his artist name, switching the ‘B’
          to ‘V’ for a more impactful touch. Despite the alteration, the
          pronunciation of his name in Japanese remains the same.

          Vaundy’s music blends various genres, including pop, rock, R&amp;B,
          hip-hop, synth-pop, and city pop. Vaundy began making music in his third
          year of middle school, using the digital production software Cubase.
          During high school, he also became active in the Vocaloid community as
          an “utaite,” (歌い手), a Japanese term for people who cover existing
          Vocaloid and J-pop songs. These covers are shared online through the
