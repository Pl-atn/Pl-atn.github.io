                    <p> Hello, I know that I have a really long name, but just call me by PL</p>
                    <p>I'm an international student from Vietnam, and English is my second language. 
                    I apologize for any grammatical errors that may have occurred. Sometimes, minor mistakes 
                    happen because my brain processes things differently when using another language. A bit 
                    more about me: I have two years of experience working as a 2D digital designer and 
                    illustrator at a small studio in Vietnam. In the future, 
                    I hope to continue developing my skills in digital design and explore new creative 
                    opportunities. I love coffee; I might be addicted to caffeine, but I'm unsure if I 
                    should stop. Without coffee, I feel like a zombie and struggle to stay awake. Otherwise, 
                    I look terrible and easily get into a bad mood. I'd love to learn more about favorite 
                    coffee or drink recipes to try out since drinking Americano too often gets boring. It might 
                    sound offensive to some, but I find it tastes terrible.</p> 
                      <p>I'm adding this sentence to meet the 150-word requirement.</p> 
                    
                   
                    </ul>
